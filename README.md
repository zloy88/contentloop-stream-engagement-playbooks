# Stream Engagement Playbooks
*by ContentLoop*

A public collection of practical playbooks for streamers who struggle with
quiet chat, dead air, or low-energy moments during live streams.

These playbooks document **repeatable interaction patterns** that keep viewers
involved without begging, forcing topics, or burning out.

## What Is Streamer Stall?

**Streamer Stall** is the moment when a stream doesn’t fail — it stalls.

It usually looks like:
- chat stops typing
- energy drops
- the streamer runs out of ideas live
- decisions become awkward or forced

The key insight:

> Quiet chat does not mean bored viewers.  
> It usually means there is no clear way to participate.

This repository exists to document ways to fix that.

## Playbooks

Start here:

- **Streamer Stall Playbook**  
  How to recover engagement when chat goes quiet  
  → `playbooks/streamer-stall-playbook.md`

- **Subathon Engagement Playbook**  
  Formats to keep chat involved between sub goals  
  → `playbooks/subathon-engagement-playbook.md`

Each playbook focuses on:
- low-effort participation
- visible outcomes (votes, rankings)
- repeatable interaction loops

## How These Playbooks Are Used

The patterns in this repository are designed to be:
- tool-agnostic
- usable mid-stream
- lightweight for the streamer

They are often implemented using shared suggestion boards,
voting systems, or viewer-driven formats.

ContentLoop exists to make these patterns easy to run live,
but the ideas themselves are platform-independent.
